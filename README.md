# Image Processing Project

A basic application used to maniplate images  

### Stuff Implemented
- Gamma correction
- Image resizing with both bilinear interpolation and nearest neighbour interpolation
- Cross correlation - Laplacian filter used (however different filters can be used by changing the matrix)

5x5 Laplacian Filter Used

 0  3  4  3  0
-1  2  3  2 -1
